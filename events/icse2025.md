Following her bachelor and masters degrees in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (with Darko Marinov and Lin Tan), Dr. Tan gained her PhD in NUS with Abhik Roychoudhury, followed immediately by becoming an Associate Professor in SUSTech. Since 2023 she has been a Gina Cody Associate Professor in Concordia University, where she founded A-PRIME.

Shin Hwei's research interests include: Automated Program Repair (APR), Open-source Software Development and Education, Software Testing, Genetic Improvement, Program Analysis and Comment Analysis. In 2019 she co-chaired the GI workshop in Montreal, she founded the APR ICSE workshop series and will co-chair FSE 2026.



## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement.
The International Workshop on Genetic Improvement is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas, and discover new research directions.

Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement.
Applications of GI include, but are not limited to, using GI to:
- Improve runtime efficiency
- Decrease memory consumption
- Decrease energy consumption
- Transplant new functionality
- Specialise software
- Generate multiple versions of software
- Improve low level or binary code
- Use of Large Language Models with GI
- Use of AI with GI
- Repair bugs
- GI techniques in industrial settings

The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion between participants.  
Authors are encouraged to submit early and in-progress work.

We invite two types of submissions:
- Research papers (eight page limit, including references)
- Position papers (two page limit, including references)

Papers should be submitted electronically [here](https://icse2025-gi-workshop.hotcrp.com/) and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template as per the [ICSE submission process](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-research-track)


Accepted papers must be presented at GI 2025 and will appear in the ICSE workshops volume.
The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE.
This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2025.
The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

The **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best paper** and **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best presentation** will be awarded during the workshop.
