## Attending

The 14th instalment of the GI workshop is will take place in Ottawa, collocated with the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering, [ICSE 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2025), which will be held in [Ottawaâ€™s Shaw Centre](https://conf.researchr.org/venue/icse-2025/icse-2025-venue).

The Shaw Centre is part of a large building complex that also includes the Rideau Centre (a shopping mall), the Westin Hotel, and the underground Rideau light rail station. It overlooks the Rideau Canal, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and is a short walk from the Byward market, Parliament, the National Arts Centre (performing arts), the National Gallery of Canada, and the University of Ottawa. It is also a short walk from most of the other [hotels that have been booked for the ICSE conference](https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2025/Hotels).

> **Put on Your Tester Hat: Improving programs for Automated Program Generation**  
> _Given either a specification written in natural language or an input program, automated program generation techniques produce a program according to the given specification or by modifying the input program. Automated program generation is a powerful technique that can be used for finding bugs in software systems that take programs as input or fixing bugs in the input programs. However, most existing techniques focus on automated program generation for automated program repair or program synthesis. This talk introduces a different perspective of automated program generation where we will discuss our latest results on automated program generation for testing static program analyzers by designing different types of program transformations. We will also explore and rethink about the automated program generation problem from the tester perspective. The new perspective could have huge potential for the design of new genetic improvement techniques to improve programs for automated program generation._

Shin Hwei Tan is an Associate Professor (Gina Cody Research Chair) in Concordia University. Before moving to Concordia University, she was an Assistant Professor in Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. She obtained her PhD degree from National University of Singapore and her B.S (Hons) and MSc degree from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her main research interests are in automated program repair, software testing and open-source development. She is an Associate Editor for TOSEM and the Guest Editors-in-Chief for the New Frontier in Software Engineering track in TOSEM. She has also served as PCs for top-tier software engineering conferences, where she won 3 best reviewers award (FSE 2020, ASE 2020, ICSE 2022 NIER-track). She is also the general chair of FSE26 which will be held in Concordia University.

## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions - [Submit Here](https://icse2025-gi-workshop.hotcrp.com/)

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement.
The International Workshop on Genetic Improvement is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas, and discover new research directions.

Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement.
Applications of GI include, but are not limited to, using GI to:
- Improve runtime efficiency
- Decrease memory consumption
- Decrease energy consumption
- Transplant new functionality
- Specialise software
- Generate multiple versions of software
- Improve low level or binary code
- Use of Large Language Models with GI
- Use of AI with GI
- Repair bugs
- GI techniques in industrial settings

The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion between participants.  
Authors are encouraged to submit early and in-progress work.

We invite two types of submissions:
- Research papers (eight page limit, including references)
- Position papers (two page limit, including references)

Papers should be submitted electronically [here](https://icse2025-gi-workshop.hotcrp.com/) and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template as per the [ICSE submission process](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-research-track) ([template](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html))


Accepted papers must be presented at GI 2025 and will appear in the ICSE workshops volume.
The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE.
This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2025.
The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

The **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best paper** and **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best presentation** will be awarded during the workshop.

Following the workshop selected papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of the [Automated Software Engineering](https://www.springer.com/journal/10515) journal  on "Genetic Improvement: Pushing the Boundaries of Automated Software Development"
