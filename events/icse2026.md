## Attending

The 15th instalment of the GI workshop is expected to take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, co-located with the 48th International Conference on Software Engineering, [ICSE 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026), which will be held at the [Windsor Barra Hotel](https://windsorhoteis.com/hotel/windsor-oceanico/?l=EN).

The Windsor Barra is a beachfront convention hotel with extensive meeting facilities and is part of a larger hospitality complex that includes several other [Windsor hotels in the area](https://windsorhoteis.com/hotel/windsor-oceanico/?l=EN), offering convenient accommodation options for conference attendees.
The hotel is situated directly across from [Barra Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XZmVHtxg2z5Bo4HJ7) and is a short distance from restaurants, shopping malls such as [BarraShopping](https://www.barrashopping.com.br/) and [VillageMall](https://www.shoppingvillagemall.com.br/), and ecological parks.

Barra da Tijuca is easily accessible from Rio de Janeiroâ€™s main airports and is connected to the city center and the South Zone via the BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) and metro system.
The venue is approximately 30 minutes by car from key cultural landmarks such as [Christ the Redeemer](https://www.paineirascorcovado.com.br/cristo-redentor/?lang=en), [Sugarloaf Mountain](https://www.bondinho.com.br/en), and the iconic neighborhoods of [Copacabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5LHa76G6ax6uBMMz6) and [Ipanema](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KTVBU975GMDo42Sx9).

The workshop is expected to be held in-person.
In case of a virtual or hybrid event, virtual presentations may be possible.

## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions -- [Submit Here](https://icse2026-gi.hotcrp.com/)

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement.
The International Workshop on Genetic Improvement is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas, and discover new research directions.

Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement.
Applications of GI include, but are not limited to, using GI to:
- Improve runtime efficiency
- Decrease memory consumption
- Decrease energy consumption
- Transplant new functionality
- Specialise software
- Generate multiple versions of software
- Improve low level or binary code
- Use of Large Language Models with GI
- Use of AI with GI
- Repair bugs
- GI techniques in industrial settings

The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion between participants.  
Authors are encouraged to submit early and in-progress work.

We invite three types of submissions:
- Research papers (eight page limit, including references)
- Position papers (two page limit, including references)
- Extended abstracts (five pages limit, including references, [free of APC charges](https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/article-types))

Papers should be submitted electronically [here](https://icse2026-gi.hotcrp.com/) and must conform to the ACM conference proceedings template as per the [ICSE submission process](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-research-track) ([template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template))


Accepted papers must be presented at GI 2026 and will appear in the ICSE workshops volume.
The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by ACM.


The **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best paper** and **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best presentation** will be awarded during the workshop.
